# Prework Study Guide Webpage

## Description

This webpage was created to provide introdutory coding students with a study guide of the basic languages they will be using in their course and work life. I built this to give an easy to read method to challenge people to retain all the new and complex information they'll be learning. It solves the problem of falling into a pattern of memorizing instead of learning by making the student study different languages at random as opposed to starting at the top of a list and going down. Additionally, it helped me learn the basics of a website and how all the elements fit together to make one final product.

A console panel should open either below or to the side of the webpage in the browser.
